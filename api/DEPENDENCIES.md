# Commons

- **express**: Simplifies building robust and scalable web applications

- **cors**: A middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Node.js applications, allowing controlled access to resources on a different domain, useful for securing web APIs. Will help restrict some requests (or all) requests for specific domain

- **morgan**: A middleware for HTTP request logging in Node.js applications, helpful for debugging and monitoring requests.

- **sequelize**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, simplifying database interactions and management in Node projects.

- **sqlite3**: A Node.js driver for SQLite, a lightweight relational database management system, useful for embedded databases or small-scale applications.

- **jsonwebtoken**: An implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT), an open standard (RFC 7519), used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

# Development

- **nodemon**: Monitors for changes in Node.js applications and automatically restarts the server, enhancing the development workflow.

- **typescript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to your code. It helps catch type-related errors during development, improving code quality and maintainability.

- **ts-node**: An executable that enables Node.js to directly execute TypeScript files

- **tsup**: A zero-config TypeScript bundler with a focus on speed. It's useful for bundling TypeScript projects, making them more efficient to load in a web browser. Helps build an unique dist bundle

- **tsconfig-paths**: A tool to help Node.js resolve module paths using the paths specified in your TypeScript configuration file. It's handy for managing complex project structures and ensuring that your imports are resolved correctly.
